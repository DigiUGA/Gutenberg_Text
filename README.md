# Gutenburg_Text
Downloads from Project Gutenberg

This collection of text was pulled from Project Gutenberg's [Top 100 Authors Yesterday](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top#authors-last1) and ended up being 1.7 Gigabytes. Only the text in English were pulled if other languages were present. Indexes were deleted. This list changes frequently on project gutenberg's website, so this list will not be the same as what it is currently. 

These were pulled using this [Gutengerg library](https://github.com/c-w/Gutenberg) since they made it very easy to pull the ebooks from them. Since pulling from Project Gutenberg required some specfic installs, virtual enviornments are best if using this library.
